<!--
make sure to watch videos >=10 mins completely and then code, not alongside. Do it only when the video is longer than 10 mins, bookmark the 
difficult chapters, come back to it and do it till you understand completely, or go to Apna College course and do it. Make sure to understand 
it though, If you get stuck go to stack overflow, and think that you're a complete actual programmer now, a professional and its a part of your 
skilled intelligent hardwork which you gotta do in order to succeed, even if its tough, you're worth it!

<>- angle brackets, as a whole is a tag, <xyz>hgk </xyz> is an element, there are headings till 6, no 7, H1 is the biggest and h6 is the 
smallest heading, only give heading h1, preferably have only one of it, no skipping of levels, and go only till h6, give paragraph tags on new 
lines and br tags on same lines, void element does not have any content in between those tags- <hr/> = horizontal line for differentiating 2lines 
or paras, type of a break element, one more is <br/>, a complete line can be commented out by ctrl+/

unordered lists are in bullet points and ordered are in numbered points, for nesting a list in another one, start just after the element in that,
nest the list before the </li> of the list you're nesting in, for more goto index2.html, anchors create hyperlinks to web pages - href ,i.e,
a link can be added, we can convert the link to any text, img src is used for source of images and alt for alternate text description, 
meaning if the image doesn't load or if its url is wrong, this alt will be shown. We can copy addr img and paste it for img src or we can save the
image in a new folder in which our index file is there where we are coding and add this new png saved image file to that folder, then we can 
add the name of file as img src in the code.


the file paths are root->project->images-> where = (for eg) ../essay.docx means to go up a level in file paths, ./dog.png is used to stay in
the current directory and find for the dog file there, that means ./ gets us into the parent directory of the current one and ../ gets up one
level above that is the parent of the parent directory; a point is slightly bigger than a pixel, 1 rem is a 1x root size, 2rem is 2x etc,
A border-width can take 4 inputs, going around in clockwise direction.


In CSS, positioning of code is vv imp. From outside to in it goes- margin-border-padding. Order of specificity- id, attribute, class, element 
(class selector starts w a dot),if 2 of same thing are there, position rule applies- last one is considered. Order- inline, internal, external. 
We can add !important; keyword to give 1st priority. Order for type- importance keyw, inline internal, class specificity, position. 
If its h1- element, or id- #something, classes- .something, then acc to the order written they will be applied for chaining for combining 
selectors. "z-index" can be used to put the element behind others on the screen using -1, default z index for everything is 0 on screen.


To create a circle in CSS-
.create a class{
background-color: ;
width: ;
height: ;
border-radius: 50% OR 100px; these are max values for a circle, beyond that it doesn't make it more round
}
