<!-- 
 Typecript is built on javascript and is a superset of js, every js file is a ts file 
 benefits-static typing, code completion, refactoring, shorthand notations
 
 static typing- c++, c#, java, meaning we can't change the type of a variable, if int then int, if str then str
 dynamic typic- javascript, python, meaning we can change the type of a variable, let number=10, number="abc" is possible
 eg- what if we pass this var to a function, how can we ensure that the type of the var is int?, we can only know that
 when error occurs after running, this can be overcome by typescript, we set the type of our var on declaration, then the compiler
 of ts tells us that there's an error,
