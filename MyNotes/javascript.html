<!-- JS is an object oriented- language, to run a file manually, mention its path name properly first, for example "node Jsfoundation\hello.js" 
is a cmd to run hello.js file in Jsfoundation folder , for printing something, output, console.log is only used, semicolon is not really needed 
but its a good pratice to have. Through keywords like let, const, var variables are assigned, esp in the case of const, we cannot change the value 
to something else by overriding it

console.log only prints what we type in the console it doesnt return us anything or give us anything back ,to s=do it we can use keyword return
where the function will get returned and closed on that line

variables-attributes which are specific to an instance of a class,A variable is a container for storing data or values. 
instance- an object within a class or constructor
functions- it is a method or a statement or a task/ block of code which performs some sort of on operation or action or has a particular behaviour in the code
You can store functions in variables., Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions(called as callback fucntions, and they allow  dynamic 
behavior, enabling reuse and modular code).,Functions can be returned from other functions., Functions can be assigned as properties of objects or classes. 
objects- a key value paired collection to store values(whatver data)and methods (function which operate on the data)
const person = {          // `person` is a variable that holds an object
    name: "Alice",        // `name` is a property with a string value
    age: 25,              // `age` is a property with a number value                         //name:alice, age:25, isstudent:true are objects
    isStudent: true,      // `isStudent` is a property with a boolean value
    greet: function() {   // `greet` is a property that holds a function (a method)
        console.log("Hello!");
    }
};
we define objects as= const/let={xyz}
argument -array like local variable used inside the functions that gives us an access to the parameters,we can access multiple args as well passed to a funcn using indexes-
  function hello() { 
        console.log(arguments[0]); 
    } 
    hello("GFG");           here arg[0] is passed since there is only one arg in hello funcn

                                 ---------------HOW DOES A FILE WORK?--------------
<!-- when a code file is saved, parsing/tokenisation is done which means some keywords like console and log are identified and creates a syntax 
tree, after this we get the JIT just in  time compiler) which converts the byte code(0,1) into machine code-->
  
                                 ----------DATATYPES-------------
<!--String, Number, Boolean, Bigint, Undefined, Null, Objects, Symbol, primitive datatypes can be converted to non-prim ds too/advanced ds-->
<!-- string interpolation- uses the actual value, symbol keyword is used and gets assigned a unique value everytime its typedin regard to the resp
variable, that;s the whole point of it, for generating a unique value
objects- defining objs is done by key value pair
to access an underlying property we use dots- username.firstname in it
for array indexing-consider this and following-

//Arrays
let demos=["a","b",true]//diff ds are accepted in arrays
//array indexing-
console.log(demos[0,1]);//will return the value of the last operand incase of comma
console.log(demos[0], demos[1]);//gives output normally for more than one values
console.log([demos[0],demos[1]]);//gives output in array format 
console.log(1+"1");// never rely on js implicit version as it considers that if one is string other might be too

if i give input true, and in console if i show the output with number(xyz),it will show its output as 1,and 0 w false-->
<!-- to create a hardcopy [...name of var], with the same name a new hardcopy can be created
if to merge 2 arrays we create 2 and simply add them, then it gives us the output in a string format, for creating a 2d array as an output, we can use[x+y] x and y being 
2 arrays, and to actually merge 2 arrays into one single array, we use x.concat(y), to see if some array includes a value we use x.includes("value") -->

                                  -----------------Functions---------------
<!-- functions and this keyword- placeholder is a parameter, and "" is and argument passed in the greet function 
we dont use string="" when passing a parameter a placeholder because it directly goes into strings and this parameter can be anything- strings, values objects arrays etc
(it is a placeholder that's why its a parameter), xyz()- is an execution, xyz- is a fucntion reference
loops- while checks the conditions first then executes the statements and do while does the conditions first then checks the condition at the end
for,for/in, for/of, forEach- are available in js, push method()-Appends new elements to the end of an array, and returns the new length of the array
for(init number,condition, inc/dec)
shift and unshift in js-shift() removes the first element from an array and returns it, while unshift() adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length. -->

                                     ----------------FOR loop types-----------------
<!-- for of- The for...of statement executes a loop that operates on a sequence of values
break- used for stopping the elements till the conditioned element, continue- skips the element at the conditioned element, an object is given by let/const var={}, inside of brackets 
we'll have "key":value, pairs, to pass on all the keys this console.log can be used for objects- console.log(Object.keys(var)); 

forin- indexing is based on keys, there is no push method in this, we have to create a key and its value, following shows how its syntax is used-
for(const (key) in (object)){           //where key- create new, obj- array w stored values(say x, and y where new values will be stored)
    //key value
    y array[key]=x array[key];
    }                 
console.log(y array);

forEach-  array.forEach(element => {});  //here array is the one w stored values and element is the one you want to access the data w so create a new one(like keys)
The forEach() method of Array instances executes a provided function once for each array element., here forEach() is a function, like for eg say function hello(), hello becomes a fucntion
function meaning functionality that wil run on each element in the array, we cannot use break or continue inside this function scope since it doesnt work for fucns it works for loops, we instead
use return to skip an element. we can either use functions or arrow element for this

forin- no push method
foreach- no break/continue, only return

length of a string(word/element) can be calculated by myString() function

returning and accepting a function is called- first-class function/higher order function-A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated 
like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable,
basically anything that takes a function or returns a function bcak in a funcn


important- Object.freeze() is used to freeze all objects so it cannot be changed further in the code, 

When a function is defined inside another function, it forms a closure. The inner function has access to: 1. Its own scope (variables defined within it).
2. The outer function's scope (variables and functions defined in the outer function).
3. Global scope (variables defined outside any function). --> 
                   
                 
                              ----------------PROTOTYPES--------------
<!-- js is basically prototype based language which is covered in obj-oriented based lang using keywords like classes, obj, constructors etc, it supports everything which oop has to support but bts is prototype based, everything is an object here
prototype- extra functionaltites and properties in any given data type, its basically a medium through which an object can access its properties
class- blueprint for creating objects/instances, defines cinstructors
objects/instances- instance is an object created from class or constructor 
dunder prototypes- 2 underscores(x)2 underscores, its can be used to access 2 prtotypes of diff objs
backticks- A template literal is a way to define a string that allows embedding expressions within the string using ${}.they are used most commonly for string interpolation
(to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). sayfor eg- i want the output of num1+num2 as a result but the values might change, yet i dont want ti change the console then-
console.log(`addition of ${num1} and ${num2} will be the ${result}`) [where result is- num1+num2], even while using backticks if i write `my name is
Sharvari Dhote`, it will take SD on another line exactly like how you wrote it

setOwnProperty-used unstead of dunder proto, meaning is used for setting a prototype
getOwnProprty-used to get acess to another function's properties 
hasOwnproperty-returns a boolean indicating whether object has specified property as its own property-->

                               ------------CONSTRUCTORS-----------
<!-- constructor- special function of class used to create/initialize an object, we use constructors to create instnaces or a type 
IN classes- the placeholders can be a variable and a function as well in js, we can store functions in a var in this
a constructor creates objects that share the same properties and methods, and they do not have a return statement as it returns the new object automatically
This-this keyword refers to the object being created when a function is called,
New-new is used to create a new instance of the object, new keyword is used to invoke this function and return the properties and functions which are stored inside the const using this, js automatically created a new object and assigns it to this keyw, a new object is created and "this" gets bound to
that object and the properties and funcs assigned to this becaomes the part of the new object, If the constructor doesn't explicitly return an object, the newly created object is returned by default.
