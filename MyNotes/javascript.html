                     ---------------------BASICS------------------
<!-- JS is a single threaded, non-blocking, async concurrent, object oriented- language, to run a file manually, mention its path name properly first, for example "node Jsfoundation\hello.js" 
is a cmd to run hello.js file in Jsfoundation folder , for printing something, output, console.log is only used, semicolon is not really needed 
but its a good pratice to have. Through keywords like let, const, var variables are assigned, esp in the case of const, we cannot change the value to something else by overriding it

console.log only prints what we type in the console it doesnt return us anything or give us anything back ,to do it we can use keyword return
where the function will get returned and closed on that line

var- this is the oldest keyword used in js, it has a global scope, if once declared out of the block, it can be accesed anywhere in the file, and if declared 
inside the block then can access only in that block
let-this is a new version of var introduced in ES6 in 2015 which has a local scope (only till the block) 
const-this has all properties that of let , same local scope, except it cannot be declared twice w same name, every time have to declar enew const variable

void keyword- The void keyword in JavaScript, is used to evaluate an expression which does not return any value,by using it, we can prevent the browser 
from displaying the result of the execution of the expression.
variables-attributes which are specific to an instance of a class,A variable is a container for storing data or values. 
instance/objects in OOPs- an object within a class or constructor, entities of real world
functions- it is a method or a statement or a task/ block of code which performs some sort of on operation or action or has a particular behaviour in the code
You can store functions in variables., Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions(called as callback fucntions, and they allow  dynamic 
behavior, enabling reuse and modular code).,Functions can be returned from other functions., Functions can be assigned as properties of objects or classes. 
objects- a key value paired collection to store values(whatver data)and methods (function which operate on the data)
const person = {          // `person` is a variable that holds an object
name: "Alice",        // `name` is a property with a string value
age: 25,              // `age` is a property with a number value                         //name:alice, age:25, isstudent:true are objects
isStudent: true,      // `isStudent` is a property with a boolean value
greet: function() {   // `greet` is a property that holds a function (a method)
console.log("Hello!");
}
};
we define objects as= const/let={xyz}
argument -array like local variable used inside the functions that gives us an access to the parameters,we can access multiple args as well passed to a funcn using indexes-
function hello() { 
    console.log(arguments[0]); 
    } 
    hello("GFG");           here arg[0] is passed since there is only one arg in hello funcn
    
    -->
    
    ---------------HOW DOES A FILE WORK?--------------
    <!-- when a code file is saved, parsing/tokenisation is done which means some keywords like console and log are identified and creates a syntax 
    tree, after this we get the JIT just in  time compiler) which converts the byte code(0,1) into machine code-->
    
    ----------DATATYPES-------------
    <!--String, Number, Boolean, Bigint, Undefined, Null, Objects, Symbol, primitive datatypes can be converted to non-prim ds too/advanced ds-->
    <!-- string interpolation- uses the actual value, symbol keyword is used and gets assigned a unique value everytime its typedin regard to the resp
    variable, that;s the whole point of it, for generating a unique value
    objects- defining objs is done by key value pair
    to access an underlying property we use dots- username.firstname in it
    for array indexing-consider this and following-
    
    //Arrays
    let demos=["a","b",true]//diff ds are accepted in arrays
    //array indexing-
    console.log(demos[0,1]);//will return the value of the last operand incase of comma
    console.log(demos[0], demos[1]);//gives output normally for more than one values
    console.log([demos[0],demos[1]]);//gives output in array format 
    console.log(1+"1");// never rely on js implicit version as it considers that if one is string other might be too
    
    if i give input true, and in console if i show the output with number(xyz),it will show its output as 1,and 0 w false-->
    <!-- to create a hardcopy [...name of var], with the same name a new hardcopy can be created
    if to merge 2 arrays we create 2 and simply add them, then it gives us the output in a string format, for creating a 2d array as an output, we can use[x+y] x and y being 
    2 arrays, and to actually merge 2 arrays into one single array, we use x.concat(y), to see if some array includes a value we use x.includes("value") -->

                                  -----------------Functions---------------
<!-- functions and this keyword- placeholder is a parameter, and "" is and argument passed in the greet function 
we dont use string="" when passing a parameter a placeholder because it directly goes into strings and this parameter can be anything- strings, values objects arrays etc
(it is a placeholder that's why its a parameter), xyz()- is an execution, xyz- is a fucntion reference
loops- while checks the conditions first then executes the statements and do while does the conditions first then checks the condition at the end
for,for/in, for/of, forEach- are available in js, push method()-Appends new elements to the end of an array, and returns the new length of the array
for(init number,condition, inc/dec)
shift and unshift in js-shift() removes the first element from an array and returns it, while unshift() adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length. -->

----------------FOR loop types-----------------
<!-- for of- The for...of statement executes a loop that operates on a sequence of values
break- used for stopping the elements till the conditioned element, continue- skips the element at the conditioned element, an object is given by let/const var={}, inside of brackets 
we'll have "key":value, pairs, to pass on all the keys this console.log can be used for objects- console.log(Object.keys(var)); 

forin- indexing is based on keys, there is no push method in this, we have to create a key and its value, following shows how its syntax is used-
for(const (key) in (object)){           //where key- create new, obj- array w stored values(say x, and y where new values will be stored)
//key value
y array[key]=x array[key];
}                 
console.log(y array);

forEach-  array.forEach(element => {});  //here array is the one w stored values and element is the one you want to access the data w so create a new one(like keys)
The forEach() method of Array instances executes a provided function once for each array element., here forEach() is a function, like for eg say function hello(), hello becomes a fucntion
function meaning functionality that wil run on each element in the array, we cannot use break or continue inside this function scope since it doesnt work for fucns it works for loops, we instead
use return to skip an element. we can either use functions or arrow element for this

forin- no push method
foreach- no break/continue, only return

length of a string(word/element) can be calculated by myString() function

returning and accepting a function is called- first-class function/higher order function-A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated 
like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable,
basically anything that takes a function or returns a function bcak in a funcn


important- Object.freeze() is used to freeze all objects so it cannot be changed further in the code, 

When a function is defined inside another function, it forms a closure. The inner function has access to: 1. Its own scope (variables defined within it).
2. The outer function's scope (variables and functions defined in the outer function).
3. Global scope (variables defined outside any function). --> 


----------------PROTOTYPES--------------
<!-- js is basically prototype based language which is covered in obj-oriented based lang using keywords like classes, obj, constructors etc, it supports everything which oop has to support but bts is prototype based, everything is an object here
prototype- extra functionaltites and properties in any given data type, its basically a medium through which an object can access its properties
objects/instances- instance is an object created from class or constructor 
dunder prototypes- 2 underscores(xyz)2 underscores, its can be used to access 2 prtotypes of diff objs
backticks- A template literal is a way to define a string that allows embedding expressions within the string using ${}.they are used most commonly for string interpolation
(to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). sayfor eg- i want the output of num1+num2 as a result but the values might change, yet i dont want ti change the console then-
console.log(`addition of ${num1} and ${num2} will be the ${result}`) [where result is- num1+num2], even while using backticks if i write `my name is
Sharvari Dhote`, it will take SD on another line exactly like how you wrote it

setOwnProperty-used unstead of dunder proto, meaning is used for setting a prototype
getOwnProprty-used to get acess to another function's properties 
hasOwnproperty-returns a boolean indicating whether object has specified property as its own property-->

------------CONSTRUCTORS AND OOPS-----------
<!-- constructor- special function of class used to create/initialize an object, we use constructors to create instnaces or a type, and is automatically invoked when an OBJECT IS CREATED, that too only once, and should awlays be assigned inside public class
types of constr- non parameterized, parameterized and copy, NP does not contain any params

eg-(apna college )
IN classes- the placeholders can be a variable and a function as well in js, we can store functions in a var in this
a constructor creates objects that share the same properties and methods, and they do not have a return statement as it returns the new object automatically
This-this keyword refers to the newly created object when a constructor function is called,in toyota example, this.make/model is pointing to newly created new car ("tata, safari")
New-new is used to create a new instance of the object, new keyword is used to invoke this function and return the properties and functions which are stored inside the const using this, js automatically created a new object and assigns it to this keyw, 
a new object is created and "this" gets bound to that object and the properties and funcs assigned to this becaomes the part of the new object, If the constructor doesn't explicitly return an object, the newly created object is returned by default.-->
 

                                     ----------------INHERITANCE-------------
<!-- class- all the functions in classes are called methods, blueprint/template for creating objects/instances, defines constructors, if for eg i want to make 50 cars, its blueprint of creating them will be defined as a class, it is used to not write same code 
just by changing its values for a lot of people's/things data and to not be a prey to bad programming 
inheritance-passing down properties and methods from parent class to child class, we use the word extends for this, which allows us to access anything from above class,  
eg- class Parent{
}
class Child extends Parent{
}
derived class is generally a type of the parent class while writing actual egs, and putting a constructor in the derived class is an optional thing
syntax to create objects from classes- let myObj= new nameofclass()
eg- class abc{
    constructor(properties){
    this.prop1=prop1
    } 
    method1(){
    return`${this.prop1}`; OR
    console.log(method1)
    }
}
    let myObj= new abc(); //calling the object, if i dont pass params here, it will show undefined in returning the statement
    console.log(myObj.method1)

method overriding :if there is a same name method in parent and child class, then it will consider and invoke child class' method,eg- myObj.abc() when abc is present in 
both parent + child, then it will invoke child's method

super keyw- used to call constructor or parent class to access the parent's props and methods by child, when we make a constructor in child class, its necessary for child
class to use super keyw and call the constrcutor which is present in parent class first

                                          ---------------------ENCAPSULATION---------------------
<!-- encap- restricts the direct access to object data, basically packing of data and functions into one component and controlling access to it to make a blckbox out of that object, due to this user of that class only knows its interface and
not the hidden implementation, you don't completely want to hide it but be able to access it with some restrictions, Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class 
to set and get the values of variables.  -->

                                  
                                        ------------------ABSTRACTION-------------
<!--Abstraction hides the complex and implementation detail, dont wanna know bts just need the messgage or data which user is asking for, it helps in code duplication, increases reusability, helps user avoid writing ll code,
change internal implementation bts w/o affecting the user, helps in increasing security, unlike data hiding(encap) it not only hides bts but also shows imp part, they cannot be instantiated, meaning cannot make objects, they're meant to be inherited.
and used to define derived classes typically and -->


                                                  ----------------------POLYMORPHISM----------------
<!-- POLYMORPHISM- describes the ability of something to have or to be displayed in more than one form , different forms might arise because these entities can be assigned diff meanings and used in various multiple contexts, it basically means the 
presentation of one's interface for multiple data, so depending on the conext an object can take on differrnt forms and behave in different ways -->

                                                      -------------DOM BOM---------------------- <!--
WE have an object window- inside that we have 3 things- DOM, BOM, javascript
generally in javascript everything comes under a window object, and window is a global object and basically provides a way to control the whole page and elements in it by 
specifically mentioning those, all the dom and bom code lines go in script.js file and the content will go in index.html file 

dom-(dhacha/elements) document object model- basically the whole page is considered as a javascript object and named as document ,this consists of elements meaning head, body, h1, etc ie elements of a code like tags and buttons
2 things will be done in this- both are connected- get the element(this is done after event listening- delete elemnet add and element add css props etc), event listening(mouse moved, hovered on an element, key was pressed , anything done on mouse keyboard etc)
to make a change or mnipulate dom, make sure to grab the event first
queryselector- allows to take a single element using css selector, returns the fuirst element matched in the doc
getelements- uses unique id attributes/class/tags etc and finds in the doc
addeventlisteners- 



bom-(working inside dhacha) browser object model-these are the additional objects provided by the host environment for working w everything else except the document, for eg redirecting to another url , connecting 2 pages togtehr thru urls ,or giving alerts on pages
whats the screen size height width etc, navigator object(navigation history shoukd we move to back page/front page), location object(whats the url,protocol,https or https,port, path etc) 
in bom- we can check window.outerWidth, window.outerheight, etc amongst many others to check screen szize , navigator.userAgent- gives us the info about the computer and user info, and navigator.userActivation shows for how long has user been active
location- location.hostname,location.href etc ,these are just a few egs theer are many more 

console log(document) is used for dom and console.log(window) {then navig,locn etc under that} is used for bom

                                               ------------------Advanced JS----------------
<!-- asynchronoys js- having a pause in network calls,write/read files,time fn, userinput, doesnt follow the sequence of what is typed, if there are 2 programs written js wont necessarily execute them in order-->
<!-- js has no capability to run the newtwrok calls, and timer function
 
Working of a javascript file- when a code is written the js checks the functions available in it which has to be executed, it enters the call stack first, then the event loop will check for it and execute the required task and remove it ffrom 
call stack, incase js doesn't have the reqd features or doesn't support some of them then the event loop transfers those functions (timer funcs/network calls funcs etc) to browser/node/bun/deno, then it gets exe by that browser and goes into a queue
it could a regular queue or fast paced etc, then its the job of the event loop to execute the functions in the queue, by the time all this happens if there are any other funcs in callstack then those are exe by event loop first and removed from it

-->

IMP- 
<!-- module,require, __filename, __dirname, exports these keywords are automatically wrapped in a function when we write commonJs code in node.js, hence we get
 to use all tehse variables directly -->
