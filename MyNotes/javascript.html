<!-- JS is an object oriented- language, to run a file manually, mention its path name properly first, for example "node Jsfoundation\hello.js" 
is a cmd to run hello.js file in Jsfoundation folder , for printing something, output, console.log is only used, semicolon is not really needed 
but its a good pratice to have. Through keywords like let, const, var variables are assigned, esp in the case of const, we cannot change the value 
to something else by overriding it

console.log only prints what we type in the console it doesnt return us anything or give us anything back ,to s=do it we can use keyword return
where the function will get returned and closed on that line-->
                                 ---------------HOW DOES A FILE WORK?--------------
<!-- when a code file is saved, parsing/tokenisation is done which means some keywords like console and log are identified and creates a syntax 
tree, after this we get the JIT just in  time compiler) which converts the byte code(0,1) into machine code-->
  
                                 ----------DATATYPES-------------
<!--String, Number, Boolean, Bigint, Undefined, Null, Objects, Symbol, primitive datatypes can be converted to non-prim ds too/advanced ds-->
<!-- string interpolation- uses the actual value, symbol keyword is used and gets assigned a unique value everytime its typedin regard to the resp
variable, that;s the whole point of it, for generating a unique value
objects- defining objs is done by key value pair
to access an underlying property we use dots- username.firstname in it
for array indexing-consider this and following-

//Arrays
let demos=["a","b",true]//diff ds are accepted in arrays
//array indexing-
console.log(demos[0,1]);//will return the value of the last operand incase of comma
console.log(demos[0], demos[1]);//gives output normally for more than one values
console.log([demos[0],demos[1]]);//gives output in array format 
console.log(1+"1");// never rely on js implicit version as it considers that if one is string other might be too

if i give input true, and in console if i show the output with number(xyz),it will show its output as 1,and 0 w false-->
<!-- to create a hardcopy [...name of var], with the same name a new hardcopy can be created
if to merge 2 arrays we create 2 and simply add them, then it gives us the output in a string format, for creating a 2d array as an output, we can use[x+y] x and y being 
2 arrays, and to actually merge 2 arrays into one single array, we use x.concat(y), to see if some array includes a value we use x.includes("value") 

functions and this keyword- placeholder is a parameter, and "" is and argument passed in the greet function
we dont use string="" when passing a parameter a placeholder because it directly goes into strings and this parameter can be anything- strings, values objects arrays etc
(it is a placeholder that's why its a parameter), xyz()- is an execution, xyz- is a fucntion
loops- while checks the conditions first then executes the statements and do while does the conditions first then checks the condition at the end
for,for/in, for/of, forEach- are available in js, push method()-Appends new elements to the end of an array, and returns the new length of the array
for(init number,condition, inc/dec)
shift and unshift in js-shift() removes the first element from an array and returns it, while unshift() adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length. -->
