<!-- JS is an object oriented- language, to run a file manually, mention its path name properly first, for example "node Jsfoundation\hello.js" 
is a cmd to run hello.js file in Jsfoundation folder , for printing something, output, console.log is only used, semicolon is not really needed 
but its a good pratice to have. Through keywords like let, const, var variables are assigned, esp in the case of const, we cannot change the value 
to something else by overriding it-->
                                 ---------------HOW DOES A FILE WORK?--------------
<!-- when a code file is saved, parsing/tokenisation is done which means some keywords like console and log are identified and creates a syntax 
tree, after this we get the JIT just in  time compiler) which converts the byte code(0,1) into machine code-->
