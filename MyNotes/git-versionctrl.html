<!-- version control system- 
sometimes softwares work somethimes they dont, this leads us to trace back to the checkpoints to see where the code was working fine, this 
is called version control  -->
commands/ to create and push a repo from terminal- <!--
mkdir xys creates xyz folder, 
ls- shows the existing folders, if no folders then no output
git --version shows the version
cd xyz- takes us to that folder/initislaises it
git status- shows status of git folder
cd .. - used to get back one folder or out of directory 
ls -Force -shows all the hidden files-->
Touch- will not work because it is a unix cmd not recognised by the powershell
<!-- New-Item xyz.txt- creates a new file in the folder
    Set-Content xyz.txt to create or overwrite an empty file.--> 
creates folder + file and shows them, now reay to add to staging area, then track it and commit it w a msg, then push 
staging area is like in intermediate zone before we commit, we can go ahead and stage and also go behind and unstage from here <!-- 
git add. -add all files to staging area/ git add xyz abc- only 2 specified files
commit -m "add file"- -m is used for adding a message
 git log- shows
commit d58264701a75a2f2bd65a21d84958af0f6c74e8d (HEAD -> master)

git log --oneline(gives log of the information and shows in oneline)
d582647 (HEAD -> master) commit this file

git config --global user.name/email- sets the global username for Git commits and returns the name and email,and this setting will be 
used on all repositories on your machine, and it shows the name and email associated with the account
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"- sets the default text editor as visual studio code, --wait flag tells us to wait till we 
finish editing the file, meaning when we have to edit something git will open vscode and wait untill we save and exit the editor

git branch abc- creates a new branch

git ignore- read by git itself and we have to create it

pwd- gives the home directory of the entire computer(Path -C:\Users\sharv\gitone )

git --config --global --list -is a global file and gives the overall info

git branch- there is a master branch, which has all nodes on which commits have been made, thsi shows the current branch which we are on 

git checkout/switch abc- checksout from current branch and changes from master to abc
in vsc in gitone this is shown in gitone/.git/log/ref/nav-bar
git checkout -b abc/git switch -c abc- creates a new branch named "abc" and will move the current pointer to that created branch

merging branches- to merge branches, first we have to verify that all the commits have been made after staging, only then we can merge 
git merge abc- opens vsc w current window which you're working on and gives a message of merging the branches, then we can save it and close the
file because code --wait will wait till we close the file completely after editing, then the merging will show in the terminal  
-->


eg-
<!-- PS C:\Users\sharv\gitone> git branch ->cmd given 
* master ->points to the master branch
PS C:\Users\sharv\gitone> git branch nav-bar ->cmd which adds another file in gitone/.git/head/nav-bar
PS C:\Users\sharv\gitone> git checkout nav-bar
A       .gitignore
Switched to branch 'nav-bar'
PS C:\Users\sharv\gitone> git branch (this shows that now the branch is pointing to the nav-bar )
  master
* nav-bar   
--> 



eg-
<!--  cd/Users/sharv
mkdir gitone
ls (shows existing if not then no op)
ls -Force (shows hidden files- .git)
cd .git(takes us to .git file)
ls(gives op)
  -->
